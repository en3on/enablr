## Requirements - Short Answer Questions

1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?
    
    The problem we are trying to solve is giving tech startups access to funding from potential investors. It is a problem that needs solving because on similar websites like kickstarter there are a ton of categories with thousands of projects in each category which can make it hard for tech projects to get any exposure. By limiting it to tech startups we can categorise projects into specific kinds of technologies.

3. Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the needs.

    The project we will be conducting is creating a Crowdfunding platform specifically for Hardware/Software Tech Startups. Our app will address the needs because it is limited to crowdfunding for tech startups.
  
4. Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.
  
    The network infrastucture the App may be based on is Kickstarter.

5. Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

    The software to be used in our App is Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

6. Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.

    The database to be used in our app is PostgreSQL. The justification for our choice is that it is compatible with Heroku deployment.
